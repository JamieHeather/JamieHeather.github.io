description: This review was a group effort from the Innate2Adaptive team. We were actually invited to submit by the Royal Society (who run Interface Focus) for their 2013 edition of <i>The Virtual Physiological Human</i>. This review just uses some examples of how we can use high-throughput and omics technologies to gain insight into what an immune system is doing, and the physiological state of that indivual - using this data as a biomonitor. Nic and I together wrote the section on adaptive immunity, covering the basics of TCR and BCR repertoire sequencing.
