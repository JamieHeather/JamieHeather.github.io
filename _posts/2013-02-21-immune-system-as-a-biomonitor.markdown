description: This review was a large group effort from the Innate2Adaptive group. We were actually invited to submit by Interface Focus (a cross-disciplinary journal run by the Royal Society) for their 2013 edition of <i><a href="http://rsfs.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royfocus/3/2.toc.pdf">The Virtual Physiological Human: Integrative Approaches to Computational Biomedicine</a></i>.<p> Our review just uses some examples of how we can use high-throughput 'omics' technologies to get a snapshot of insight as to what the immune system is doing, and how that might be used as a biomonitor. Nic and I together wrote the section on adaptive immunity, i.e. T and B cell receptor sequencing.
