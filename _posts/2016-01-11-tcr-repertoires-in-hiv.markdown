description: <a href="https://github.com/JamieHeather/JamieHeather.github.io/raw/master/_pdfs/Heather_2016_FrontImmuno_HIV_TCRs.pdf">Download pdf</a><p>This was the major paper of my PhD, in which I apply the error-correcting TCR sequencing pipeline we had developed to a number of RNA samples from the peripheral blood of HIV+ patients, and compared it to similar samples taken from uninfected healthy volunteers. In it I make use of a number of metrics to show how the TCR repertoire becomes perturbed in HIV patients: effectively, a small number of (mostly CD8) T-cells appear to expand dramatically, which (along with the expected depletion of CD4+ T-cells) leads to hugely skewed diversity. We also made some nice use of searching for CDR3s of known specificities: while we see the frequency of HIV-associated CDR3s decrease over a short course of anti-retroviral therapy, the frequency of CDR3-associated sequences increases, perhaps as result of other viral specificities being able to expand into the space left as HIV-restricted clones contract. We also observed a massive depletion of MAIT cell sequences in HIV relative to healthy levels, consistent with other recent findings by flow, although whether this reflects a loss of these cells or their sequestration of these cells in some non-blood compartment we cannot say.
