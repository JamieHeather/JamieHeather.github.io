description: <a href="https://github.com/JamieHeather/JamieHeather.github.io/raw/master/_pdfs/Wong_2016_JI_CVID_TCRs.pdf">Download pdf</a><p>This paper holds a particular prestige for me, as it's my first publication with Mark Cobbold's group, yet it happened before I'd actually started in the lab!<p> This work is the product of Gabriel Wong, an MD PhD from Mark's lab in Birmingham (which he left for MGH about a year before I started working for him). My contribution to this paper was extremely minimal, having been only brought on after the first round of reviewers to help flesh out a couple of the analyses, so I shan't say too much about it here beyond a quick summary.<p> Effectively this is a close examination of the TCR repertoires of patients with Common Variable Immmunodeficiency, which is often typically thought of/dealt with as just a B-cell disorder. Using TCRseq, flow cytometry among other tests Gabriel and colleagues showed that a particular subgroup of patients' pathology may be driven by a deficit of naive T-cells, resulting in a lack in repertoire diversity which likely contributes to their susceptibility to infection.
