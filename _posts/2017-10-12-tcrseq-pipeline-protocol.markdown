description: <a href="https://github.com/JamieHeather/JamieHeather.github.io/raw/master/_pdfs/Oakes_Heather_2017_TCR_protocol.pdf">Download pdf</a><p>The culmination of many years work from many people, this is the first formal publication describing the TCR sequencing protocol and pipeline I helped develop at the Chain lab in UCL (although note that it's not the first paper to use it). This improves upon the previous protocol as was using in my 2016 Frontiers in Immunology paper through the redistribution of where the barcodes are used, and having padding sequences before the random barcode regions so as to be able to find them even in the event of read 'slippage'. This paper also describes how to analyse the TCR sequences produced using the updated v3 Decombinator TCR analysis suite.
