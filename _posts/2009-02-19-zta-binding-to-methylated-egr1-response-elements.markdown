description: This is my first publication, produced from the lab of Professor Alison Sinclair at the University of Sussex, with whom I did my MSc project followed by a short Fellowship.<p>In this position I was investigated the ways by which the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) transactivator Zta - a crucial protein involved in switching to the lytic viral stage - mediates its effects through binding to its response elements (ZREs) in DNA. In addition to identifying putative novel ZREs in the viral genome we were also very interested in potential regulation of the host genome. In this paper, we focussed on the promoter for the gene <i>EGR1</i>, which had previously been shown to be regulated by Zta and to contain ZREs, but the contribution of those sites to Zta binding was unknown. <p>Through use of electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), we were able to show that Zta binds to the more distal site stronger than the proximal one (albeit weaker than it does to well characterised sites in the viral genome). However, Zta is able to preferentially bind to methylated response elements - presumably as a mechanism to transactivate even in an epigenetically silent context - and this distal site contained a CpG motif, so we assessed binding to methylated <i>EGR1</i> probes. Not only did Zta bind to methylated probes much more strongly, but it was also able to drive expression off a reporter construct in a methylation-enhanced fashion, suggesting that Zta is able to preferentially target itself to methylated sites in the host genome as well as its own.
