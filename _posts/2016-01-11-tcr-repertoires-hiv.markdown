description: <a href="https://github.com/JamieHeather/JamieHeather.github.io/raw/master/_pdfs/Heather_2016_FrontImmuno_HIV_TCR_RepSeq.pdf">Download pdf</a><p>This was the major biology paper of my PhD, i nwhich I apply the error-correcting TCR sequencing pipeline we had developed to a cohort of HIV patients, comparing their repertoires before and shortly after beginning treatment to healthy volunteers.<p>In it I make use of a number of metrics to show how the TCR repertoire becomes perturbed in these patients: effectively a small number of (primarily CD8) T cells appear to expand dramatically, which in combination with the dramatic loss of CD4 T cells leads to hugely skewed diversity.
