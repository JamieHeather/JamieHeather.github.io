description: <a href="https://github.com/JamieHeather/JamieHeather.github.io/raw/master/_pdfs/Heather_2016_Genom_DNA_Sequencers.pdf">Download pdf</a><p>This was my <i>first</i> first author paper to come out of my PhD. It's very simply a review of the history of DNA sequencing, a brief look back at a field often looking instead to the next big thing. In it I also discuss a formalised view of the first three generations of DNA sequencing technology, and highlight some of the key researchers and technologies of each.<p>This is a paper that I wrote with the intention that it would be of particular use to students new to the field, and I'm particularly proud that it seems to have met that goal. After publication it rapidly became (and still remains, years later) the journal's <a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/genomics">most downloaded <i>and</i> most cited paper!
