description: <a href="https://github.com/JamieHeather/JamieHeather.github.io/raw/master/_pdfs/Heather_2016_Genom_DNA_Sequencers.pdf">Download PDF</a><p>This was my <i>first</i> first author paper to come of my PhD at UCL.<p>This paper is very simply a review of the history of DNA sequencing, a brief look back in a field whose literature tends to just look forward to the next exciting thing, which I hope will be of particular use to students new to the field. In it I use the largely-agreed upon definitions of the first three generations of DNA sequencing technology, and highlight some of the key researchers, methodologies and machines of each.<p>I'm particularly proud of this paper for its broad usage: after publciation it rapidly became (and still remains, years later) the journal's <a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/genomics">most downloaded <i>and</i> most cited paper!
