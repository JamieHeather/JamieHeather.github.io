description: <a href="https://github.com/JamieHeather/JamieHeather.github.io/raw/master/_pdfs/Heather_2016_Genom_DNA_Sequencers.pdf.pdf">Download PDF</a><p>This was my <i>first</i> first author paper to come of my PhD at UCL.<p>This paper is very simply a review of the history of DNA sequencing, a brief look back in a field whose literature tends to just look forward to the next exciting thing, which I hope will be of particular use to students new to the field. In it I use the largely-agreed upon definitions of the first three generations of DNA sequencing technology, and highlight some of the key researchers, methodologies and machines of each.<p>The review was actually an adapted chapter introduction I wrote for my PhD thesis: given as it was a very sequencing-heavy document going to be judged by immunologists I wanted to give a nice bit of background, and I found once I started I sort of couldn't stop.
