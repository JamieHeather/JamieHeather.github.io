description: <a href="https://github.com/JamieHeather/JamieHeather.github.io/raw/master/_pdfs/Heather_2015_Genom_DNA_Sequencers.pdf">Download pdf</a><p>This was my <i>first</i> first author paper to come of my PhD at UCL.<p>This paper is very simply a review of the history of DNA sequencing, a brief look back in a field whose literature tends to just look forward to the next exciting thing, which I hope will be of particular use to students new to the field. In it I use the largely-agreed upon definitions of the first three generations of DNA sequencing technology, and highlight some of the key researchers, methodologies and machines of each. <p>The review was actually an extended introduction chapter I wrote for my [PhD thesis](http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1470278/1/thesis.pdf): given as it was a very sequencing-heavy document going to be judged by immunologists I wanted to give a nice bit of background, and I foundd once I started I sort of couldn't stop.<p>Incidentally, this was also the first paper for which I took the sole responsibility to sort out finding a journal, pitching the paper (as a pre-submission inquiry, given it wasn't an invited review), sorting out the reviews and just generally being the corresponding author. As an aside, it's definitely a good learning experience for a postgrad, but it's also incidentally the doorway to a whole lot more email spam.
