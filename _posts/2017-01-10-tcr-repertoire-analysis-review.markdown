description: <a href="https://github.com/JamieHeather/JamieHeather.github.io/raw/master/_pdfs/Heather_2017_BIB_TCR_Repertoire_Analysis_Review.pdf">Download pdf</a><p>I was very lucky over the course of my PhD to see the field of TCR/BCR repertoire sequencing emerge in real time, which is quite an exciting thing to watch and in some small way take part in. It's no secret that I'm very firmly entrenched in the camp that believes in the power of these technologies to deliver power to research and medicine. However, with new protocols and pipelines - not to mention an ever increasing number of groups moving their analyses to sequencing - comes a torrent of new data.<p>This review aimed to paint a broad picture of the tools and softwares that have been developed to analyse this data, but also to delve into the core concepts that they use to do so. The hope is that it will not only help brief readers on the history of the topic and the tools currently available, but also perhaps help inform the development of the next wave of exciting analyses.
